# Diabetes in Pima Indians Females
Finding insights from Pima Indians Diabetes Datasets
The dataset contains information about Pima Indian Females above the age of 21. The idea behind the analysis was to gather information about the number of females having diabetes in a defined age group as well as to determine the average BMI so that further relationships can be determined.


# Findings and Summary
